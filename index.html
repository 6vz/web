        <h2>📫 Contact me</h2>
        <p><b>I like talking to people.</b> The best way to contact me is by calling (no joke). Dial <a href="tel:+48221031314">(+48) 22 103 13 14</a>. This number is a Polish Landline number, fees may apply depending on your operator. Calls will be recorded, only to keep track of who called me, and to keep track of the conversation, no 3rd party will have access to this.</p>
        <p>You can always e-mail me at <a href="mailto:info@6vz.dev">info@6vz.dev</a>. This way is better, if you do not live in Poland/EOG, since it will be free for you, but it can take some time until I reply</p>
